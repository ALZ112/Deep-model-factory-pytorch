## 🎯 GAN Loss Functions

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are trained using **two separate loss functions** — one for the **Discriminator** and one for the **Generator**. These losses are derived from a minimax game between the two models.

## 🔴 Discriminator Loss

The **Discriminator (D)** aims to correctly classify:
- **Real images** as real (label = 1)
- **Fake images** generated by the Generator as fake (label = 0)

### Mathematical Formulation

\[
\mathcal{L}_D =
- \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[\log D(x)]
- \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))]
\]

### Interpretation
- The first term rewards the discriminator for recognizing real images.
- The second term rewards the discriminator for rejecting fake images.

### Implementation

```python
d_real_loss = BCE(D(real_images), real_labels)
d_fake_loss = BCE(D(fake_images), fake_labels)
d_loss = d_real_loss + d_fake_loss
